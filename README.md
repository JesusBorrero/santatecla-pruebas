### Units
The knowledge is structured as units, which can be related to each other with different types of relationships. The teacher can add new units and relationships and edit existing ones.

### Itineraries edit and cards
#### Cards
Different aspects of each unit will be managed in cards. These cards contain text in Asciidoc format.

#### Itineraries
In the itinerary manager you can edit the different itineraries of a unit. These itineraries will consist of a series of slides which will contain as well as de cards, text in Asciidoc format.

Editing itineraries include operations such as asserting cards, slides of other itineraries and questions. Also you can add images, umls and code examples.

### Exercises

A unit has different exercises. Teacher can manage them adding, deleting and editing questions. Also he can correct it by his own.
Students are able to answer the questions of the units they belong.

### Course and progress

The teacher can join a group of units into a personalized course for a group of students. In order to check the progress of the students, teacher can consult some personalized tables for each course. This progress check is divided into student progress and unit progress.

#### Student profile

The student's profile can consult the courses the student is in. In this courses the student can do exercises and read itineraries and views.
